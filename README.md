# SFMC-TS Data Extension Helper

SFMC TS is a Node.js library that provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud API. It simplifies the process of managing data extensions, allowing developers to work with Marketing Cloud data in a more streamlined and efficient way.

## Installation

To install the SFMC TS library, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install sfmc-ts
```

## Usage
To use the SFMC Helper library, you must first initialize it with your API configuration:

```js
import SfmcAPI from "sfmc-ts";

const sfmc = SfmcAPI({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  authEndpoint: "https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.auth.marketingcloudapis.com",
  restEndpoint: "https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.rest.marketingcloudapis.com",
  businessUnitId: "YOUR_BUSINESS_UNIT_ID",
  soapEndpoint: "https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.soap.marketingcloudapis.com"
});

```

Once initialized, you can use the `dataExtension` method to interact with data extensions:

```js
const dataExtension = sfmc.dataExtension("DATA_EXTENSION_OBJECT_KEY");

// Fetch a row by a key column and its value
const row = await dataExtension.row("Email", "someone@example.com").get();

// Upsert a record in the data extension
await dataExtension.row("Email", "someone@example.com").upsert({
  FirstName: "John",
  LastName: "Doe",
});

// Query the data extension (fetch all)
const records = await dataExtension.get().where("FirstName", "eq", "John").where("LastName", "eq", "Doe");
```

## Reference

### Config

Represents the configuration object for the Marketing Cloud API.

#### Properties

- `clientId`: The client ID for the Marketing Cloud API.
- `clientSecret`: The client secret for the Marketing Cloud API.
- `authEndpoint`: The authentication endpoint for the Marketing Cloud API.
- `restEndpoint`: The REST API endpoint for the Marketing Cloud API.
- `businessUnitId`: The business unit ID (clientID) for the Marketing Cloud API.

### SFMC API (Main Object)

Factory function to create a Salesforce Marketing Cloud Helper instance.

#### Parameters
  - `config`: The configuration object for the SFMC API.
  
- Returns an object with a `dataExtension` method that creates a new instance of the `SfmcDataExtension` class.

### Data Extension

Represents a data extension in the Marketing Cloud API.

#### Methods

##### row(keyColumn: string, keyValue: string)

Returns a row API for a specific key column and key value.

- `keyColumn`: The key column name (usually primary key name).
- `keyValue`: The key value - column value of row you are trying to fetch/modify.
- Returns an object with the following methods:
  - `get()`: A method that returns a promise with the row data or undefined.
  - `upsert(record: object)`: A method that updates or creates a row in the data extension.

##### get()

Fetches all rows from the data extension.

- Returns an instance of the `SfmcQueryBuilderWhere` class with a `where` method to filter data.

### Where Clause Builder

Interface for the `SfmcQueryBuilderWhere` class.

#### Methods

##### where(columnName: string, operator: string, value: string)

Adds a WHERE clause to the query.

- `columnName`: The column name for the filter.
- `operator`: The comparison operator for the filter as a string. The supported values are `"eq"`, `"ne"`, `"lt"`, `"le"`, `"gt"`, `"ge"`, and `"like"`.
- `value`: The value for the filter.


## Roadmap
- Add support for the SOAP API (âœ… basic implementation).
- Add support for more operators between conditions (OR, etc.)
- Add additional functions to interact with other objects in the Marketing Cloud API
- Implement more granular error handling and logging capabilities.
