# SFMC-TS Data Extension Helper

SFMC TS is a Node.js library that provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud API. It simplifies the process of managing data extensions, allowing developers to work with Marketing Cloud data in a more streamlined and efficient way.

## Installation

To install the SFMC TS library, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install sfmc-ts
```

## Usage
First, initialize the SFMC Helper library with your API configuration:

```js
import SfmcAPI from "sfmc-ts";

const sfmc = SfmcAPI({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  authEndpoint: "https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.auth.marketingcloudapis.com",
  restEndpoint: "https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.rest.marketingcloudapis.com",
  soapEndpoint: "https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.soap.marketingcloudapis.com",
  businessUnitId: "YOUR_BUSINESS_UNIT_ID",
});

```

Once initialized, you can use the `dataExtension` method to interact with data extensions:

```js
const dataExtension = sfmc.dataExtension("DATA_EXTENSION_OBJECT_KEY");

// Fetch a row by key column and value
const row = await dataExtension.row("Email", "someone@example.com").get();

// Upsert a record in the data extension
await dataExtension.row("Email", "someone@example.com").upsert({
  FirstName: "John",
  LastName: "Doe",
});

// Query the data extension (fetch all)
const records = await dataExtension.get().where("FirstName", "eq", "John").where("LastName", "eq", "Doe");

// Use SOAP API if needed
const resultSoap = await sfmc
  .dataExtension("DataExtensionName")
  .soap
  .get(["Name", "Name2"], {
    queryAllAccounts: true,
  })
  .where("Name", "equals", "test");
```

## Reference
Detailed reference documentation can be found in the [REFERENCE.md](REFRENCE.md) file.

## Roadmap
- Add support for the SOAP API (âœ… basic implementation).
- Add support for more operators between conditions (OR, etc.)
- Add additional functions to interact with other objects in the Marketing Cloud API
- Implement more granular error handling and logging capabilities.
